# Oxford Independent Coffee Shop

This is a MySQL database build specifically for the independent coffee shops. The short name of the project is called `oxford_cafe`. With the `MySQL` queries you will be able to: 

1. find out which coffee shop provide wifi and plugs for charging and 
2. allow visitors to work out how much they can save on coffee when they bring travel mug themselves. 
3. For the owner of the coffee shops, they can use the created view to understand how coffee sales had been in the Oxford area.
